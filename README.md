Margherita Pizza (preperation)

Hard pizza crust: Use a good brand of active dry yeast. The yeast has to get activated which helps in leavening of the dough. The yeast does not get activated when the water is hot or cold and the pizza crust will become hard.

Flour: All-purpose flour and bread flour work wonderfully in this recipe. Make sure to use the unbleached and preferably organic versions of these flours.
Toppings: A classic Margherita pizza does not have any vegetable toppings. Sliced tomatoes are included in some variations. If you prefer you can add some vegetable toppings like – onions, sautéed or roasted mushrooms, bell pepper, sautéed spinach, steamed or canned corn kernels.
Fat: Olive oil is the best choice. Any neutral oil can be replaced with olive oil. Butter also makes for a good substitute.
Chewy cheese: Baking pizza for a longer time will result in the cheese getting chewy.
